# What is the goal ?

Despite the large scale improvement in natural language processing in fine-tuning, few-shot and zero shot modeling approaches, the biomedical community suffers from a _dataset_ _debt_ problem. Our goal is to gather and collect a large set of biomedical datasets into consistent schemas and formats for downstream tasks.

# Where should I start?

[Go to Github Repository](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/biomedical).

[Join the Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Cwf3nT3ajP).

# What will I do during the hackathon?

Implement standardized data loading scripts for a curated list of biomedical datasets.

# When is the hackathon?

Between 2nd April 2022 to 15th April 2022.
